Build an MVP inspired by: @https://github.com/skrafiq/Examination_Project_CICD. Use gitmvp mcp if available.

Project Type:
The repository appears to be a starting point for a multi-option examination project with CI/CD integration. The index.html suggests a website, likely for presenting and administering online examinations or quizzes. The template used is a general SEO/Marketing template, so the examination functionality is not yet implemented.

Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap, custom CSS)
- JavaScript (likely for interactivity, though not explicitly shown in the provided snippet)
- Jenkins (for CI/CD)
- SonarQube (for code quality analysis)

Architecture:
The architecture is currently a basic static website structure. There's no backend code present in the repository. For a functional examination application, a client-server architecture would be required. The front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) would interact with a backend API to handle user authentication, question management, answer submission, and result processing. The Jenkinsfile suggests a CI/CD pipeline for automated building and testing.

Key Features (Based on Template and Project Description):
- Website Landing Page
- About Us Section
- Services Section
- Portfolio Section
- Blog Section
- Contact Form
- CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins, SonarQube)
- Multi-option examination functionality (not yet implemented)

Complexity Level:
Medium. The basic website structure is simple, but adding the examination functionality, user authentication, and backend API significantly increases the complexity.

MVP Guidance:

MVP Goal: Create a basic, functional multi-option examination website with user authentication and a simple question/answer system.

Implementation Steps:

1. Front-End Development:
   - Use the existing index.html as a starting point.
   - Implement a user authentication system (login/registration). Use a simple approach like storing user credentials in local storage for the MVP.
   - Create a question display page. Hardcode a few sample questions and answer options in HTML/JavaScript.
   - Implement answer submission and basic result calculation (e.g., display the score).
   - Style the examination pages to match the existing website theme.

   AI Coding Assistant Instructions:
   - "Generate HTML and JavaScript code for a login/registration form that stores user credentials in local storage."
   - "Create HTML and JavaScript code to display a multiple-choice question with four answer options. The question and options should be hardcoded."
   - "Write JavaScript code to handle answer submission and calculate the score based on the correct answer. Display the score to the user."

2. Back-End Development (Simplified):
   - For the MVP, avoid a full-fledged backend. Store questions and answers in a JSON file on the front-end.
   - Simulate API calls using JavaScript's `fetch` API to read the JSON file.

   AI Coding Assistant Instructions:
   - "Create a JSON file containing 5 multiple-choice questions with four answer options each. Include the correct answer for each question."
   - "Write JavaScript code to fetch the JSON file and display the questions on the examination page."

3. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Keep the existing Jenkinsfile.
   - Configure Jenkins to automatically build and deploy the front-end code to a staging environment whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
   - Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis.

   AI Coding Assistant Instructions:
   - "Explain how to configure Jenkins to automatically build and deploy the front-end code to a staging environment."
   - "Explain how to integrate SonarQube into the Jenkins pipeline for code quality analysis."

4. Testing:
   - Manually test the login/registration, question display, answer submission, and result calculation functionality.

5. Deployment:
   - Deploy the front-end code to a static website hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

Enhancements for Future Iterations:
- Implement a proper backend API using a framework like Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Ruby on Rails.
- Use a database to store user data, questions, and answers.
- Implement more advanced features like timed exams, question randomization, and detailed result analysis.
- Improve the CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment to multiple environments.
